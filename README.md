U of O Data Analytics - Module 21 Challenge

## Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

Optimization
Attempt #1: Add more neurons. Changed the first hidden layer to 95 and the second to 60. This had little to no affect on loss or accuracy. 268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5679 - accuracy: 0.7258 - 473ms/epoch - 2ms/step Loss: 0.5678666830062866, Accuracy: 0.7258309125900269

Attempt #2: Add third layer with the same number of neurons as the 2nd layer. This had little to no effect on loss or accuracy. 268/268 - 1s - loss: 0.5675 - accuracy: 0.7303 - 784ms/epoch - 3ms/step Loss: 0.5675201416015625, Accuracy: 0.7302623987197876

Attempt #3: Change the split of the training and testing data to 80% and 20%, respectively. Little change: 215/215 - 0s - loss: 0.5658 - accuracy: 0.7262 - 491ms/epoch - 2ms/step Loss: 0.5657766461372375, Accuracy: 0.7262390851974487

Attempt #4: reverse the split so testing data is 80%. Little change in the final loss and accuracy, though accuracy got as high as 75% while the model was running - Epoch 50/50 215/215 [==============================] - 1s 3ms/step - loss: 0.5141 - accuracy: 0.7552. 858/858 - 1s - loss: 0.5778 - accuracy: 0.7231 - 1s/epoch - 1ms/step Loss: 0.5777688026428223, Accuracy: 0.7231049537658691

Attempt #5: add more features by changing the limits on CLASSIFICATIONS and APPLICATION_TYPES. Also tried to lower the number of epochs from 100 to 50. This had the biggest improvement but did not reach the target accuracy. 268/268 - 1s - loss: 0.5560 - accuracy: 0.7266 - 837ms/epoch - 3ms/step Loss: 0.5559502840042114, Accuracy: 0.7266472578048706

## Summary
Because Alphabet Soup wants to know whether an applicant will be successful or not and most of the features are binary input variables, a logistic regression model might be better suited for this task.
